- Create a Binary Tree class
- Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
- pre order
- in order
- post order

## Collaborations

Reference to Code Review from instructor Ryan Gallaway. Utilized GPT for assistance with tests.


## Tree-Max

Find the Maximum Value in a Binary Tree.

Write the following method for the Binary Tree class

- find maximum value
- Arguments: none
- Returns: number

## Collaborations DSA-16

My partner and I worked at separate times but came together just to chat about the overall outcome of the DSA assignment. Also, utilized GPT for some guidance on tests.
